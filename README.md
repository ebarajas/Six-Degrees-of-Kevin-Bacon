Download the Actors and Actors list from IMDB in the following links:
ftp://ftp.fu-berlin.de/pub/misc/movies/database/actors.list.gz
ftp://ftp.fu-berlin.de/pub/misc/movies/database/actresses.list.gz

Run the file using ./bacon.pl *.list.gz (Or whatever directory you have the files stored in)

The program will take a few minutes to load everything
Once loaded, you can input a name, preferably in the Last Name, First Name format
If there is more than one of the same actor, they are differentiated by roman numerials after their name
If a direct match is not found, the program will try to find a similar match

Enter a blank line, or CTRL-C to exit the program.
